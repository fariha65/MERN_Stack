                <hr/>
                <p>Become an effective and resourceful physiotherapist, comfortable working within a rapidly changing healthcare environment.
Physiotherapists play an increasingly central role in enabling others to improve their health, wellbeing and quality of life by managing pain and preventing disease. They use a broad range of treatment approaches focused on restoring movement and function, often following illness or injury.
We hold strong links with physiotherapists working in health and social care, as well as the private sector and in social enterprise settings across the Greater London area. We utilise the expertise of clinicians to contribute to the course design, teaching sessions and provision of practice placements.
Our programme provides an accelerated 2-year route for graduates with a first degree in a related field.
